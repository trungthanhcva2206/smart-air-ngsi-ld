## Migration Guide

### From v0.0.1 to v1.0.0

**⚠️ Breaking Changes:**
- Database schema changed from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
- API endpoints restructured (added `/api/open/` prefix)
- Authentication now required for protected endpoints
- NGSI-LD context format updated to latest standard
- Docker Compose file completely rewritten

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   # Export entities from old Orion-LD
   curl http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities > backup-entities.json
   ```

2. **Update Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   # Stop old containers
   docker-compose down -v
   
   # Pull new images
   docker-compose pull
   
   # Start new stack
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb smartair
   
   # Run migration scripts
   cd backend
   mvn flyway:migrate
   ```

4. **Update Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Copy new config template
   cp application.example.properties application.properties
   
   # Update your credentials
   nano application.properties
   ```

5. **Import Data:**
   ```bash
   # Use new ETL scripts
   cd etl
   python import_entities.py --file backup-entities.json
   ```

6. **Create Admin User:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Admin","email":"admin@smartair.local","password":"SecurePass123!"}'
   ```
